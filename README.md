# CS50 Ai Course

Welcome to my personal repository for the CS50 AI course! Here, I will maintain all my projects completed during the Harvard course.

This repository contains projects, exercises, and any additional materials related to the CS50 AI course. Feel free to explore the content and follow along with my progress as I work through the course materials.

**This is Project 4 - Nim**

*The idea behind this project is to write an AI that teaches itself to play Nim through reinforcement learning.*

Example:

    $ python play.py
    Playing training game 1
    Playing training game 2
    Playing training game 3
    ...
    Playing training game 9999
    Playing training game 10000
    Done training
    
    Piles:
    Pile 0: 1
    Pile 1: 3
    Pile 2: 5
    Pile 3: 7
    
    AI's Turn
    AI chose to take 1 from pile 2.
