# CS50 Ai Course

Welcome to my personal repository for the CS50 AI course! Here, I will maintain all my projects completed during the Harvard course.

This repository contains projects, exercises, and any additional materials related to the CS50 AI course. Feel free to explore the content and follow along with my progress as I work through the course materials.

**This is Project 2 - PageRank**

*The idea behind the project is to: Write an AI to rank web pages by importance (an ‚Äúimportant‚Äù page is one that many other pages link to).*

Example: 

  $ python pagerank.py corpus0
  
  PageRank Results from Sampling (n = 10000)
  
    1.html: 0.2223
    2.html: 0.4303
    3.html: 0.2145
    4.html: 0.1329
    
  PageRank Results from Iteration
  
    1.html: 0.2202
    2.html: 0.4289
    3.html: 0.2202
    4.html: 0.1307
