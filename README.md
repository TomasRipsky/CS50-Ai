# CS50 Ai Course

Welcome to my personal repository for the CS50 AI course! Here, I will maintain all my projects completed during the Harvard course.

This repository contains projects, exercises, and any additional materials related to the CS50 AI course. Feel free to explore the content and follow along with my progress as I work through the course materials.

**This is Project 6 - Attention (Final Project of the Course)**

*The idea behind this project is to write an AI to predict a masked word in a text sequence.*

Example:

    $ python mask.py
    Text: We turned down a narrow lane and passed through a small [MASK].
    We turned down a narrow lane and passed through a small field.
    We turned down a narrow lane and passed through a small clearing.
    We turned down a narrow lane and passed through a small park.
    
    $ python mask.py
    Text: Then I picked up a [MASK] from the table.
    Then I picked up a book from the table.
    Then I picked up a bottle from the table.
    Then I picked up a plate from the table.

Here we will also generate attention diagrams to drive conclusions as the shown in the analysis.md file.

*The diagrams look like this:*
