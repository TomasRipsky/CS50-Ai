# CS50 Ai Course

Welcome to my personal repository for the CS50 AI course! Here, I will maintain all my projects completed during the Harvard course.

This repository contains projects, exercises, and any additional materials related to the CS50 AI course. Feel free to explore the content and follow along with my progress as I work through the course materials.

**This is Project 0 - degrees**
Idea behind the project is to: Write a program that determines how many ‚Äúdegrees of separation‚Äù apart two actors are.

Example:

    $ python degrees.py large
    
    Loading data...
    
    Data loaded.
    
    Name: Emma Watson
    
    Name: Jennifer Lawrence
    
    3 degrees of separation.
    
    1: Emma Watson and Brendan Gleeson starred in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix
    
    2: Brendan Gleeson and Michael Fassbender starred in Trespass Against Us
    
    3: Michael Fassbender and Jennifer Lawrence starred in X-Men: First Class
